## Description

Trolley Problem was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe&#8217;s FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/)Â library. It uses a sound effect I made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and the title track was made with [WolframTones](http://tones.wolfram.com/). The font in Trolley Problem is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/).

~~You can read [my writing about the game](http://www.pippinbarr.com/tag/trolley-problem?order=asc) on my blog.~~ Trolley Problem was written about on [Alphr](http://www.alphr.com/games/1002218/how-games-like-the-walking-dead-turn-us-into-armchair-philosophers).

Trolley Problem has appeared in the exhibition [The Games of Art](http://www.ciprecinct.qut.edu.au/archive/2013/games-of-art.jsp) at the [QUT Creative Industries Precinct](http://www.ciprecinct.qut.edu.au/).

## Ah, Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I've made a [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)-based emulation version, the source code, and the original `.swf` file available at the moment. For some reason you can't switch tracks in the tutorial level? Ah, emulation.
