Train (Any point? Or just a FlxSprite…)
Track (Any point? Or just a FlxSprite…)
Person (Any point? Or just a FlxSprite…)
Lever (Any point? Or just a FlxSprite…)
Bridge (Any point?)
[My suspicion is that I need very little in the way of "special" behaviours because the game itself is so incredibly simple.]




=== SOUNDS ===

Need a "bip" sound for when the train hits a person
Maybe need a "blarp" sound when the fat guy falls
Need a bip sound for when the tracks move.
All should just variants on a beep though.
-- All can come from bfxr

Probably some cute soundtrack - WolframTones!!!



=== GRAPHICS ===

Just draw them in Pixen and export.
Animation: Lever, track switch, fat man… (train of course, but it will be following a path)

(Note, too, that the entire game could be made up of giant animations that you just switch between… if FlxPath is hard, that will be easy enough.)


=== SCREENS ===

In each screen we need to have an explanation and then the "simulation" runs. Probably on separate screens I suppose. Maybe an opening stage which is a tutorial which shows you how to change the train tracks of not - maybe get them to do both so they understand the process...
